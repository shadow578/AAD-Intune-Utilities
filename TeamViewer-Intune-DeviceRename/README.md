# TeamViewer-Intune-DeviceRename

this is a script to automatically add the name of the primary user of a device to its alias in teamviewer.

e.g. you have a device 'PC0100' with a primary user 'Peter Parker'. 
this script will set the alias of the device to 'PC0100 [Peter Parker]'.


## Usage

tbh, this script was created quite a while back, so i don't fully remember how it has to be setup. 
you might want to use this script as a basis for your own version instead...
