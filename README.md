### TL;DR and Notes

- Feel free to use or modify these scripts however you like (even if you are commercial)
- I hold no liability on the fitness of these scripts. So if something goes horribly wrong, you're on your own
- If you make changes to one of these scripts that could be useful for other people, I'd be nice if you shared them (create a PR, or ask you local software guy for help on this)
- Have fun (this is not mandated by any license)
